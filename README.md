# grep-but-worse

Literally a worse version of grep. Wouldn't ever use this but was a nice lesson in learning more about grep as well as recursive functions.

## If you really want to use this...

Clone the repo and just compile with g++ or clang.
Move the executable to your path if you reallyyyy want to use this piece of s\*\*\*.

## Next steps

- [ ] Get backreferences working
- [ ] Multiple backreferences
- [ ] Nested backreferences

## Huge thanks to:
